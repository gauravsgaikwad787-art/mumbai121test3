            <h2>What is MUMBAI121?</h2>
            <p>Mumbai121 is a social impact initiative dedicated to connecting Mumbai's fresh talent and people with
                disabilities to startups and small businesses. We believe in creating an inclusive and empowered job
                ecosystem—one where every capable individual gets a fair chance, and every small business finds the
                right talent to grow.</p>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p><strong>Empowering Talent. Enabling Growth.</strong></p>
            <p>Mumbai121 is a project of HRIM INTERNATIONAL TRUST, a Private Trust committed to inclusive development
                and social upliftment through skill-building, employment support, and community collaboration.</p>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
            <p>In a city as dynamic as Mumbai, countless individuals—especially youth and people with disabilities—struggle
                to find meaningful work. At the same time, startups and small businesses often lack the resources to
                access skilled and willing talent.</p>
            <p>We bridge this gap by offering a 100% free platform for candidates and companies. There are no fees, no
                middlemen, and no barriers—just real opportunities, real people, and a shared goal of inclusive
                progress.</p>
